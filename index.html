                        Perfect Blue is one of Satoshi Kon's most outstanding works. A complex and classic movie that may or may not have inspired others, such as "Black Swan" and "Requiem for a Dream."   Fans have praised the movie for its stunning visuals, disturbing yet surreal scenes, deep symbolism, and mind-bending story. It is one of the many key strengths that Satoshi Kon has shown through his works repeatedly.
