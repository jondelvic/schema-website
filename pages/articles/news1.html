            <!-- Paste article paragraphs here -->
            <div class="article-content">
                <!-- Lead paragraph is the first paragraph which will be emphasized or bold -->
                <p class="lead-paragraph">Running unopposed, the candidates of Reporma ng mga Mag-aaral ng San Luis-Alliance of Concerned Students (REPORMA-ACS) for the Executive Committee went on stage to face the panel of judges and the crowd for this academic year’s Miting De Avance in Room P700 at Saint Louis University’s Main Campus, yesterday, October 7.</p>
                <p>Spearheaded by SLU’s Commission on Elections and in collaboration with SLU’s Debate Society and school publications, the 3-hour program was divided into two segments: the Question and Answer and the Fast Talk portion.</p>
                <p>As a precedent of the Q&A, the yellow party first presented their individual projects. Secretary for Business Affairs candidate Gayle Dela Pena emphasized mental wellness and thus presented Telecounseling and Sketch the Stress: Chalk Art under her project ‘Wag Kang Matakot. Meanwhile, Secretary for Public Relations aspirant Jeremiah Dumaguin introduced Tansan Thesis, Skill-Based Outreach Program (SBOP!), and Kasama Telemagasin - projects that aim to develop a Louisian’s skills and talents. Kaylie De Vera, Secretary for Audit, focuses on supporting working students and briefly discussed Project ABCDE. Moreover, Secretary for Finance candidate Kane Taylor proposes projects providing free pictures for graduating students and dorm-finding initiatives for Louisians. </p>
                <p>If elected, Lei Casaclang, under the Office of the Secretary, plans to establish the State of the Louisians Address, Leadership Training for SSC officers, and the Centralized Grievance Desk. Meanwhile, running as Vice President, Wendel Matias envisions a university that fights discrimination towards any gender and proposes the provision of free sanitary and hygiene equipment, promotion of HIV/AIDS awareness, and the duplication of the KASAMA/SSC SAMCIS Assembly’s Drag Race on the Main Campus. Lastly, aspiring KASAMA/ SSC Executive Committee President Ashli De Castro prioritizes giving Louisians quality education and emphasizing students’ human rights and space by creating the CICM Council of Leaders, Study Hubs, and Alternative Classroom Learning Experience.</p>
                <p>The first candidate questioned for the Q&A was Jeremiah Dumaguin. Running for secretary for public relations, he was asked how he would improve the voter turnout this year, considering that only 900 votes were cast out of the 24,000 total population. He suggested incentivizing students to vote supplemented with campaigning outside the election season and having events that allow for better student engagement.</p>
                <p>Dela Peña was asked when enough is enough for student leaders who attempt to run for office again if their previous terms were ineffective. She noted that the Kasama SSC is not likely to be ineffective as there are training and other platforms for new officers to ensure that they are well-oriented with their duties. A follow-up question by Hon. Christine Faith Mallillin concerning sanctions for students that grow to be ineffective within the office was responded to by Dela Peña, bringing up the process of impeachment and additional assessment from OSA can help identify whether previous officers are fit to re-run as an alternative to banning them from running entirely.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, candidate De Vera was asked how their administration and position would uphold transparency, considering it is highly depanded both from student leaders. To ensure a standard of transparency, she cited the demand of the breakdown and justification of tuition fees and its increase from the school admin and having a 48-hour policy for every breakdown of SSC’s future projects. A follow-up question given by Hon. Allain Christopher Bulatao raised attention to the fact that the school admin has not responded to any of the previous demands of the SSC. De Vera plans to re-establish relations with the school admin, such as the guidance office, office of student affairs and services, and other departments within the school.</p>
                <p>Taylor, the candidate running as secretary for finance, was asked about how he would restore the relationship of the SSC with the school admin in light of their lack of response towards TOFI and the NSTP red-tagging forum last year. He responded by saying that the SSC and student welfare will not simply be limited by these actions of the school administration and noted that it is crucial that all students collectively support the SSC in demanding transparency reports alongside the SSC’s lobbying, which he claimed helped decrease the 9% TOFI down to 7% last year.</p>
                <p>Casaclang, the executive secretary aspirant, presented a strategy of meeting with the university president on plans to strengthen the student portal and using SOSA as an answer to how she could improve the bureaucratic inefficiency regarding the enrolment process of the school. Hon. Villamor Dumlao followed through by asking how the candidate would serve as a bridge to connect the IT department to the school admin regarding future enrolment strategies, noting the university’s competent IT department. Casaclang responded that she would advocate for the competence of the IT department through SOSA. </p>
                <p>Matias, vice president aspirant, was asked which was better between having flashier higher impact but less likely to manifest platforms or meager lower impact platforms that are more likely to manifest. He said that it is possible to have both since, regardless of the level of impact, all platforms are still important to pursue. He even cited the Magna Carta drafted by the SSC in collaboration with other school organizations last year, which he aims to have signed by the school admin this year. He noted that strategic planning can help supplement the implementation of certain platforms that seemed visionary to ensure that they would be effective.</p>
                <p>The seventh and final candidate Ashli De Castro, running for president, was asked how she would ensure that the next SSC after her term would continue this SSC and previous SSCs’ projects. She emphasized that there is great importance in consolidating and uniting the campaign and platforms of REPORMA-ACS with the other political parties of the school since they all work to uphold the same rights and principles. She continued that aside from this unity of platforms, its continuity would be ensured through the bills, resolutions, and amendments of the Congress of Louisians, which would solidify the agendas of all future SSCs. </p>
                <p>Following the Q&A was the Fast Talk segment, which presented 15 issues that the candidates would respond to with their signs of a thumbs up or a thumbs down to signify their support or otherwise. </p>
                <p>At large, all candidates shared the same sentiments, especially in supporting reproductive healthcare services and legalization of same-sex marriage while opposing legalization of recreational drugs, dress code policy, tuition fee increase, retention policy in quota courses, increasing security precautions for entering school, “A friend to all, enemy to none” BBM foreign policy, supporting the CHED memorandum for RTF-ELCAC or the Regional Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict within universities, the rise of AI in replacing traditional journalism, widespread adoption of cryptocurrency in the Philippines, and heightened animosity towards elites. Opinions, however, were divided in two topics. </p>
                <p>On the automation of manual labor, De Castro, candidate for president, explained that her thumbs up was because she believed that technology could be used to simply enhance and not replace. On the contrary, Taylor, candidate for secretary for finance, explained that he disapproved of this because technology is primarily being used to replace human labor in the status quo but still agrees with the former that it can be used for enhancement if appropriately used. </p>
                <p>Running Secretary for Audit De Vera agreed to the proposed charter change together with Dela Peñ as she believed there is a need to amend many obsolete laws within the constitution. Speaking on behalf of those who disagreed, De Castro explained that while there is a need for change, the Marcos Administration could see this as an opportunity to extend his presidency like the former dictator. </p>
                <p>On the radicalization of student activism, while all candidates raised a thumbs down, De Castro explained that student activism should be sectoral rather than radical and commented on how radicalism can paint a bad picture for different movements such as feminism and LGBTQ rights. Afterwards, a sole question asking each candidate how they would convince the student body to vote for them given the circumstances.</p>
                <p>“A lot of your concerns are asked here — you’ve submitted your questions and skepticisms. It’s important to listen to these because it’s unfair when you give criticisms and don’t even try to be open to persuasion,” said panelist Hon. Allain Christopher Bulatao, addressing concerns that arose from holding a debate for the unopposed execom slate. </p>
