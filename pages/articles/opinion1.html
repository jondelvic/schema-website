                <!-- Lead paragraph is the first paragraph which will be emphasized or bold -->
                <p class="lead-paragraph">Before September ends, let us take the time to pause, and reflect on the past and the current status of our country. Five decades have passed since the Martial Law and, every year we commemorate the era that has brought fear, blood, and violation to many Filipinos. Five decades might have passed, but the same Marcos name still sits in Philippine Politics. With the same family in power, are the current implementations another political agenda to empower the Marcoses? </p>
                <p>On September 21, 1972, the late President Marcos declared Proclamation 1081, which placed the entire Philippines under Martial Law. The declaration of martial law was the country’s last defense against rising communism. The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and New People’s Army (NPA), these organizations were the strongest in the 1980s. However, defeating communism might not have been the desired result for Marcos Sr. It was told that the country was in a war against communism, yet,  70,000 people were arrested, 34,000 tortured, 3,240 lives lost, and 1,600 disappeared.</p>
                <p>In July 2020, the Anti-Terror Bill became the Anti-Terrorism Act. The vague terms in the proposed law are now used to freely “red-tag” anyone who is against one’s best interest—victims of red-tagging become subjects to political bigotry and prejudice. Red tagging is now used to suppress freedom of expression, assembly, and political rights. Since the implementation of the Anti-Terrorism Act also known as the “License to Kill Act”, it has led to 801 political prisoners and 442 victims of extrajudicial killings. It is a tool made and used to prosecute or kill anyone who opposes government-backed projects.</p>
                <p>Comparing the 1972 and the present have little to no differences. Filipinos are resilient, a quality that has brought us through storms and brutal regimes. But the suffering brought by these events should not increase our resilience rather be lessons in identifying what is wrong.</p>
                <p>On this solemn occasion, as we mark the 51st anniversary of Martial Law, let us honor the unwavering courage of our fallen journalists. They stood as sentinels of truth, paying the ultimate price to ensure that the voice of truth would never be silenced.</p>
                <p>In commemorating this somber chapter of our history, we are not merely recalling the, we are forgoing a path forward. “Never again, never forget” resonates as our rallying cry, a potent call to action that propels us toward a brighter future. Together, we stand united in our mission to nurture a society where truth reigns supreme, democracy thrives, and the valor of our fallen heroes lives on, forever etched in our unwavering dedication to a tomorrow where justice and hope prevail.</p>
