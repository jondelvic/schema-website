            <div class="article-content">
                <!-- Lead paragraph is the first paragraph which will be emphasized or bold -->
                <p class="lead-paragraph">On the 25th of May, a man walked into a grocery store and bought a pack of cigarettes. Thirty minutes and a suspected fake 20-dollar bill later, George Floyd lost his life to police officer Derek Chauvin.</p>
                <p>The case of George Floyd is, sadly, nothing new. The world has been struggling with racism for a long amount of time, almost as long as history itself—wars, colonization; all of these are a large and unfortunate part of humanity’s past.</p>
                <p>In an ideal world, this would have stayed history; acts of cruelty towards each other would have stayed as distant memories. And in a positive light, society has become more and more progressive, specifically in media. People of Color have been appearing in movies with central roles. Although seemingly small, this act is enough for young people of color to finally have role models of their own race who they can look up to. Children will find dolls that share their features, watch superheroes that show how strong their race is Eventually, if we do it right, we can overlook race entirely, and start seeing each other as the same race: Human. </p>
                <p>The presence of people like Officer Derek Chauvin and his needless cruelty make it harder for us to progress. And, sadly, there are several who feel and act the same way: how many people share the skewed opinion that African-American men are, by default, criminals and delinquents? Alternatively, how many people believe that Caucasian people are all a highly sensitive, gun-toting race? Asians are seen as closed-minded people who enjoy eating animals typically kept as pets and lewd things. Hispanics are seen as cheap border crossers desperate for a better life. </p>
                <p>We overlook the beauty of skin color, the preciousness of culture. </p>
                <p>The simple act of wearing our traditional clothes and singing songs in our native language can do wonders for how we feel about ourselves. When we see other countries’ native dances, styles, and listen to their songs, we are being given a large window to their culture, to their world.</p>
                <p>The world has these cruel opinions, almost on default, because it has been raised this way, because it has been taught that these are harmless things. It ignores the beauty of our diversity.</p>
                <p>No longer.</p>
                <p>Protests have been rising up in defense of George Floyd. Social media has become a blazing storm of people who want to see this way of thinking changed. We should do better. We can teach ourselves that people are people, regardless of race, and every man and woman is born a human being with human rights. Change the way you think. Change the way you see other people. It starts with you. It starts with us. </p>
                <p>If we rise up as a human race, we can finally let our world breathe. </p>
