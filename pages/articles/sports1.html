                <p class="lead-paragraph">The School of Accountancy, Management, Computing, and Information Studies (SAMCIS) secures top seed for the playoffs with a flawless record after outperforming the School of Engineering and Architecture (SEA) in a nail-biter, 93-89, in men’s basketball held at Prince Bernhard Gym, October 24.</p>

                <p>The arch-rivals engaged in a relentless exchange of offensive plays as they maintained a neck-and-neck showdown, not letting each other widen the gap right from the jump ball down to the final buzzer.</p>

                <p>SEA nearly clinched the match in the last quarter, but SAMCIS showcased an impenetrable defense and executed fast-paced plays that ultimately secured their victory.</p>

                <p>SAMCIS couldn't maintain their typical dominance in the game as several players received technical calls and warnings, primarily due to taunting and challenging the calls.</p>

                <p>“Mas mag improve pa po kami sa game, at gagawin ko po yung best ko sa semi-finals to championship,” said Zen Carreon, one of SAMCIS’ guards, in preparation for the next round of the men’s basketball.</p>

                <p>In the upcoming semi-finals, SAMCIS (1) is set to compete against the School of Nursing, Allied Health, and Biological Sciences (SONAHBS) (4) on October 28.</p>
