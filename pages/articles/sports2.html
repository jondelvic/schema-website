                <p class="lead-paragraph">The School of Accountancy, Management, Computing, and Information Studies (SAMCIS) Women’s Volleyball Team (WVT) finished the elimination round with an all-win record, defeating the School of Teacher Education and Liberal Arts (STELA) in three sets, 19-25, 25-20, 25-14, for their final elimination game yesterday, October 23, at the Bishop Carlito Cenzon Sports Center.</p>

                <p>The match kicked off with both teams performing aggressively, where long rallies took place in the first set. Nonetheless, STELA’s outstanding offense and defense resulted in a large point advantage of 24-15. SAMCIS registered multiple attack points and a service ace to make the point gap small at 19-24. However, STELA was able to stop this run by SAMCIS via an attack point, claiming the first set 19-25.</p>

                <p>Set two started with both teams exchanging errors with each other, keeping the scores close. Good receptions and digs from both teams resulted in many long rallies throughout the second set. The Technocommercians started dominating the second set with Teresa Camille Oblero and Dezsaera Mae Monang’s collective attack points and service aces, resulting in a final score favoring SAMCIS, 25-20.</p>

                <p>Encouraged to win the team’s sixth game, set three started in favor of SAMCIS via Monang’s attack point and a service ace. Despite STELA's efforts to halt SAMCIS's momentum, the yellow-clad team continued to dominate the set, displaying excellent digs, receptions, and powerful serves. Oblero and Monang’s consistent performance and Feline Anne Viloria’s steady sets helped the team gain total control of the deciding set, eventually winning the set and the match 25-14.</p>

                <p>SAMCIS WVT has successfully wrapped up the elimination round of the intramurals with an unblemished record, winning all six matches played by the team for this round. The team is now gearing up for their upcoming semifinal match scheduled on October 27, hopeful of maintaining their undefeated record.</p>
