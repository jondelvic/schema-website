                <p class="lead-paragraph">On October 22, the School of Accountancy, Management, Computing, and Information Studies (SAMCIS) made their mark on the podium as they clinched the championship in the men's category and secured the second spot in the women's category in an exhilarating futsal tournament at the Bishop Carlito Cenzon Sports Center, October 22.</p>

                <p>Five teams participated in the Futsal competition, with SAMCIS being joined by the School of Medicine (SOM), the School of Teacher, Education and Liberal Arts (STELA), School of Nursing, Allied Health, and Biological Sciences (SONAHBS), and the School of Engineering and Architecture (SEA).</p>

                <p>In their first game against STELA, the Technocommercians showcased their prowess, securing a 5-1 victory. Their dominance continued into their second game, facing off against SEA, where they secured a commanding 3-0 win, leaving no room for the opponent to score. The third game, against SONAHBS, saw an even more determined SAMCIS amassing an impressive 6 points while SONAHBS managed to secure just 1.</p>

                <p>With both teams boasting flawless records, SAMCIS went against SOM in their final and deciding match. SAMCIS delivered a standout performance, outperforming SOM, scoring 4-0, and cementing their title in the competition.</p>

                <p>“Sa SOM, sobrang kabado kami doon kasi nga ang hirap kasi nila [kalaban]. Lalo na ngayon,  nagdagdag sila ng players at may mga dating navi doon. Ang ginawa naming tactics doon is binantayan namin yung isang player na ‘yon para makuha namin ulit yung championship,” explained Aldrin Corpuz, the coach of the men's team.</p>

                <p>“Siguro ‘yung gigil namin na manalo bawat game. Ayon tinuloy-tuloy namin yung momentum namin hanggang sa matapos yung laro,” said Ajx Abuiza, when asked about the key to their success during the games. Faculty Coach Mr. Karlo Dacanay also mentioned, “Make sure lang na ‘wag magpakampante sa mga kalaban nila.”</p>

                <p>Abuiza also mentioned that their training contributed a lot and was a significant factor in the team's championship defense. He stated, "Siguro ‘yung training namin sa Bakakeng na almost every day, every after class. Siguro nag bunga yung training namin.”
                    Sharing the podium with the Men's team are SOM and SEA, who claimed the first and second runner-up positions, respectively.
