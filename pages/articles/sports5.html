                <p class="lead-paragraph">The strategic brilliance of the School of Accountancy, Management, Computing, and Information Studies (SAMCIS) chess players shone brightly as they clinched the coveted titles in both the men's and women's categories during the 2023-2024 Intramurals chess competition happened yesterday, October 22, at the Prince Bernhard Gymnasium.</p>

                <p>
                    The men's team embarked on their journey with a first-round bye. And from then on, they showcased their dominance with an impressive 4-0 victory over the School of Law (SOL) in the second round and a resounding win against the School of Medicine (SOM) in the sixth round.
                    </p>

                <p>Simultaneously,  the women's team delivered a flawless 4-0 record over SOL, SAS, STELA, and SOM. They also earned 3 points from their triumph over SEA and 1.5 points from their match with SONAHBS, accumulating a total of 20.5 points to seize the championship.</p>

                <p>In the men's team, John Joeffrey Barry was honored as the best in board number 2, while John Francis Gonzales clinched the best in board number 3 title. On the women's side, Destin Kate Kinuh-Ol secured the best board number 1 award, Zaira Ashley Mendoza excelled as the best in board number 3, and Deniellle Angeli Tomas earned recognition as the best in board number 4.</p>

                <p>Along with Barry and Gonzales in the men’s team were Ethan Gyzer Saong, who played as board number 1, and Jonison Molintas, representing board number 4. The team was under the guidance of their Coach, Mr. Ramel Cabanilla. In the women’s team, Kinuh-ol, Mendoza, and Tomas were complemented by the contributions of Sarah Jen Villafania and Geraldine Benitez  guided by their coach, Mr. Orly Rimorin.</p>

                <p>Kinuh-ol revealed her strategy saying, “Nanonood ako ng mga videos and doon ako natututo, and trust in the Lord.” Additionally, Kinuh-ol highlighted that their team's strategy revolves around trust as well.</p>

                <p>Saong confirmed that there is indeed pressure of being the defending champions, facing new players from various teams and adapting to a new venue. He stated, "Opo, kasi ‘yung mga players po ngayon iba-iba [...] so unfamiliar ‘yung laro nila. Tapos [...] siyempre ‘yung mga ibang schools binabantayan kami kasi kami ‘yung defending champions."
                    </p>

                <p>Following SAMCIS in the standings are SEA and SONAHBS who were awarded as the first and second runners-up in both the men's and women's categories.</p>
