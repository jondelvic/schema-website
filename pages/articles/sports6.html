                <p class="lead-paragraph">The School of Accountancy, Management, Computing, and Information Studies' (SAMCIS) badminton team secured 4th place in the men's division and 5th place in the women's division during this year's intramurals badminton competition held at the Prince Bernhard Gymnasium, on October 15.</p>

                <p>
                    In a round-robin format that saw seven teams in action, the men's team secured victories against the School of Nursing, Allied Health, and Biological Science (SONAHBS), School of Medicine (SOM). It was awarded a default win against the School of Law (SOL). On the other hand, the women's team achieved wins against SOM and the School of Advanced Studies (SAS).
                    </p>

                <p>SAMCIS's men's team failed to secure the crucial doubles match against the School of Engineering and Architecture (SEA) and the School of Advanced Studies (SAS) to arrive at 5 wins and 1 loss and secure a spot on the podium.</p>

                <p>The men's team featured the talents of Dave Hindang, Von Smith, and Lawrence Tao-Tao. In contrast, the women's team was comprised of Stephanie Faith Ferrer, Shyra Monique Tolentino, and Ariane Jade Dagdagui, all under the guidance of Coach Rafael Joy Toquero.</p>

                <p>Preparing for the intramurals, Hindang mentioned, "Three weeks before ng event nag setup kami ng court sa Devesse lobby. Although hindi ganon ka actual ‘yung size ng court minaximize pa rin namin yung space na available sa lobby, para naman may practice and laban sa ibang schools.”</p>

                <p>"Sa STELA and SEA, kasi powerhouse sila sa players, pero lumaban pa rin kami, we fought a good fight." Hindang's bet as the challenging team to face in the competition.</p>

                <p>The awardees included champions from SAS in the men's division and SONAHBS in the women's division. Additionally, the School of Teacher, Education, and Liberal Arts (STELA) and SEA secured second and third place, respectively, in both men's and women's divisions.
